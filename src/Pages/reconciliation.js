// ***** What is reconciliation in ReactJS **** ?
// The mechanism to diff one tree with another to determine which parts
//  need to be changed and then update the original DOM with it is called Reconciliation 


// ***** Higher-Order Components ****
// a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

// **** Integrating with Other View Libraries ****
// React can be embedded into other applications thanks to the flexibility of createRoot().

// Although React is commonly used at startup to load a single root React component into the DOM, 
// createRoot() can also be called multiple times for independent parts of the UI which can be as small as a button, 
// or as large as an app.

// In fact, this is exactly how React is used at Facebook. This lets us write applications in 
// React piece by piece, and combine them with our existing server-generated templates and other client-side code.
