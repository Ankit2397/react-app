  <!--1 Static Server Rendering Optimizations -->

  <!-- Static Site Generation (SSG) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) are great ways to get 
  performance for cacheable pages, but we think we can add features to improve performance of dynamic 
  Server Side Rendering (SSR) – especially when most but not all of the content is cacheable. 
  We’re exploring ways to optimize server rendering utilizing compilation and static passes. -->

 
  <!--2 Asset Loading -->

  <!-- Currently, assets like scripts, external styles, fonts, and images are typically preloaded and loaded 
  using external systems. This can make it tricky to coordinate across new environments like streaming, 
  server components, and more. We’re looking at adding APIs to preload and load deduplicated external 
  assets through React APIs that work in all React environments.
  
  We’re also looking at having these support Suspense so you can have images, CSS, 
  and fonts that block display until they’re loaded but don’t block streaming and 
  concurrent rendering. This can help avoid “popcorning“ as the visuals pop and layout shifts. -->
