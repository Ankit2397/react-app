// #GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type 
// system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is 
// instead backed by your existing code and data.

// #WDS_SOCKET_HOST 

// When set, Create React App will run the development server with a custom websocket hostname for hot module reloading. 
// Normally, webpack-dev-server defaults to window.location.hostname for the SockJS hostname. You may use this variable 
// to start local development on more than one Create React App project at a time. See webpack-dev-server documentation 
// for more details.

// #PUBLIC_URL
// Create React App assumes your application is hosted at the serving web 
// server's root or a subpath as specified in package.json (homepage). Normally, Create React App ignores the hostname. 
// You may use this variable to force assets to be referenced verbatim to the url you provide (hostname included). 
// This may be particularly useful when using a CDN to host your application.

// #CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING
// When set to true, the watcher runs in polling mode, as necessary inside a VM. 
// Use this option if npm start isn't detecting changes.

// #DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN
// When set to true, eslint-webpack-plugin will be completely disabled.


// #Fetching Data with AJAX Requests
// React doesn't prescribe a specific approach to data fetching, but people commonly use either a library 
// like axios or the fetch() API provided by the browser.

// The global fetch function allows you to make AJAX requests. 
// It takes in a URL as an input and returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object.
