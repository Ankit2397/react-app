// ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library used to build the user interface for Web Applications. 
// It is responsible only for the view layer of the application. 
// It provides developers to compose complex UIs from a small and isolated piece of code called "components.

// Advantage of ReactJS
// Easy to Learn and Use
// Reusable Components
// Performance Enhancement
// Creating Dynamic Web Applications Becomes Easier

// React Native
// React Native is an open-source JavaScript framework used for developing a mobile application for iOS Android, and Windows.
// t uses only JavaScript to build a cross-platform mobile app. React Native is same as React, 
// but it uses native components instead of using web components as building blocks. 
// It targets mobile platforms rather than the browser.

// Advantages of React Native
// Native Components
// Cross-Platform Usage
// javaScript
// Improving with Time

// When to use a Hooks
// If you write a function component, and then you want to add some state to it, previously you do this by converting it 
// to a class. But, now you can do it by using a Hook inside the existing function component.

// Rules of Hooks

// 1. Only call Hooks at the top level

// 2. Only call Hooks from React functions



// React Redux is the official UI bindings for react Application. 
// It is kept up-to-date with any API changes to ensure that your React components behave as expected.
// It encourages good 'React' architecture.
// It implements many performance optimizations internally, which allows to components re-render only when it actually needs.

// **** The components of Redux architecture are explained below. ****

// #STORE: A Store is a place where the entire state of your application lists. 
// It manages the status of the application and has a dispatch(action) function. 
// It is like a brain responsible for all moving parts in Redux.

// #ACTION: Action is sent or dispatched from the view which are payloads that can be read by Reducers.
//  It is a pure object created to store the information of the user's event. 
//  It includes information such as type of action, time of occurrence, location of occurrence, 
//  its coordinates, and which state it aims to change.

// #REDUCER: Reducer read the payloads from the actions and then updates the store via the state accordingly.
// It is a pure function to return a new state from the initial state.

// #Redux Installation
// Requirements: React Redux requires React 16.8.3 or later version.

// To use React Redux with React application, you need to install the below command.

// $ npm install redux react-redux --save
